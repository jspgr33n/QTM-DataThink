# Reducing Churn Rate for the BBB
> Emory University Quantitative Theory &amp; Methods Department: DataThink Program

**Goal:**
- Perform an analysis on Membership data from the Better Business Bureau's Interactive Blue system and deliver insights &amp; recommendations focused on reducing cancellations.

**Skills Used:**
- Tableau
- Python
- R

**Observations & Recommendations:**
- Majority of churned customers come from companies with 10 or less employees.
  - Within this subsection, focus on companies with $1m in annual revenue, as there is a large cluster of churned customers here.
- Nearly all companies have emails, but a large portion of those churned do not.
  - Make sure companies have emails to maximize utilitiy: receive get-a-quote requests, a key feature of the BBB membership.
- Companies who have churned tend to have lower change in their ratings.
  - Focus on informing smaller companies of the benefits of a BBB membership.
